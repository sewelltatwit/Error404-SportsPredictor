# Sports Predictor

## Introduction

Sports betting has always been prevalent throughout the modern age. It has become easier to place a bet on a team since the internet is everywhere. However, for someone who is starting to watch and bet on sports, it seems scary to lose money on sports that you have not researched on. 
For our project, we propose to create a web application to take information such as past performances and how efficient the team is during this season from both teams playing to give predictions on who would win. Our project would be easy to use for people who are starting to learn the sport. Simply put, the information needed is how good the teams are during the season. We could do all four major sports in the US, but we are focusing on football with the potential to expand to the other major sports. 
Our project is different from other sports prediction apps because other apps have users making predictions and bets without any statistical background. Our solution aims to be a way to get involved in sports betting in a lower risk way, similar to low risk stock portfolios. We are hoping since we are using past data to form predictions rather than using human judgement, the results will be more accurate for users. There will never be a 100% guarantee because anything can happen, but it will be a lower risk approach.
